# Coursera Capstone Project: Using machine learning to predict road collision severity based on road, weather and light conditions

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Models predicting global mortality from 2002 to 2030 indicate road accidents to be the fourth leading cause of deaths globally [1]. Along with the economic growth of major cities, the demands and complexity of transportation increase. Despite the advent of technology, the number of road accident-related fatalities seem counterintuitive in this day and age. The United States is one of the busiest countries in terms of road traffic with nearly 280 million vehicles in operation and has a traffic fatality rate of ~50 percent higher than similar nations in Western Europe, plus Canada, Australia and Japan [2]. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows that nearly 100 people are killed every day in the USA due to road accidents [3]. Apart from the emotional and physical trauma, these road accidents have major economic costs (billions of dollars) associated with them [4]. A lot of factors such as road and weather conditions, location, time of the day, etc. can contribute to a road accident. As the demands and complexity of transportation networks grow, the need for information supporting decisions about that network continues to increase and should include significant data on weather, road conditions, pedestrians, bicycles, trucks, etc. These decisions aid in making the necessary changes and help reduce road accidents and thereby fatalities. 
### 1.2 Problem
Road collisions can lead to major emotional, physical and economic hardships. Road accidents can be caused due to a lot of reasons (e.g. road and weather conditions, location, speeding, etc.) that may either act individually or in combination with other factors. This project aims to employ machine learning algorithms to predict the severity of road accidents based on road, weather and light conditions. 
### 1.3 Target audience
This project utilizes data for collisions in Seattle from 2004 to present collected by SDOT. The breadth and depth of the data collected allows objective discussion of project merits and results, be it a new crosswalk or an entire safety corridor. Prediction models such as the ones created in this project will: (1) help the authorities to make decisions about modifying infrastructure as and when necessary, (2) help local authorities to put out alerts when road and weather conditions meet the criteria for a high probability of fatal road accidents, (3) help insurance companies and government to save money and (4) also alert the public to be extra cautious when their route is about to come across such bad conditions.
